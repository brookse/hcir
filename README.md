# hcir

<h2>Overview</h2>
Front-end user interface implementation used for SE-499 Independent Study. <br><br>
Users are provided with an interactive search engine for learning medical concepts from natural language text. Define a medical concept, and the system will learn that concept, scrape databases for information on the concept, and provide related information so you can expand their mental model of the concept.<br><br>
Users may also search through real-world patient records in order to view trends in maladies and symptoms, prescriptions and their side effects, and physician records.<br><br>
Note: no API exists for this app. This is simply a user interface to revamp the old interface and demonstrate HCIR (human computer information retrieval) techniques. <br>
